# Astroport Generator

The Generator contract allocates token rewards (ASTRO) for various LP tokens and distributes them pro-rata to LP stakers. The Generator supports proxy staking via 3rd party contracts that offer a second reward besides ASTRO token emissions. Allowed reward proxies are managed via a whitelist.

---

## InstantiateMsg

Initializes the contract with required addresses and contracts used for reward distributions.

```json
{
  "owner": "terra...",
  "astro_token": "terra...",
  "tokens_per_block": "123",
  "start_block": "123",
  "allowed_reward_proxies": [
    "terra..."
  ],
  "vesting_contract": "terra..."
}
```

In order to stake in the Generator contract, you should execute this message inside the contract of the LP token you want to stake.

```json
{
  "Deposit": {}
}
```

In order to stake in the Generator contract, you should execute this message inside the LP token you want to stake.

    "amount": 999,
    "msg": "base64-encodedStringOfWithdrawMsg"

In `send.msg`, you may encode this JSON string into base64 encoding:

```json
{
  "DepositFor": "terra..."
}
```

```

### `emergency_withdraw`
